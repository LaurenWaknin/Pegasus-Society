            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p> 
                The establishment of the Pegasus Society can be attributed to Zvika Tamuz from "Moked Hai" ("Living Hotline"), 
                a dedicated animal rescuer since 1993. With over two decades of experience in horse care, Zvika recognized the 
                escalating issue of equestrian animal abuse in Israel in 2004. Other animal welfare organizations began referring 
                cases to him, recognizing his expertise and facility for their care. Word quickly spread about someone actively 
                rescuing and tending to neglected and mistreated horses and donkeys. The National Traffic Police, the National 
                Roads Association, and municipal veterinarians, facing situations with stray horses or donkeys posing risks to 
                themselves and others, started reaching out to Zvika for assistance, acknowledging his ability to provide support 
                in such challenging circumstances, which they themselves were unfamiliar with.

                As the cost of iron surged, numerous inhabitants in the occupied territories began searching the border area of the 
                Sharon plain, collecting scrap iron, often resorting to theft. This phenomenon marked a new era characterized by an 
                increase in the number of horses and donkeys experiencing severe physical distress while working in the region. 
                Disturbed by the distressing scenes of these malnourished and injured animals pulling heavily loaded carts of scrap 
                iron, residents from Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Hod HaSharon, and other areas flooded in with complaints. The animals, 
                subjected to merciless beatings by their owners to keep them moving, often collapsed on the streets, incapable of 
                continuing. Various animal welfare organizations receiving these distress calls directed them to Zvika Tamuz.
            </p>
            <p>
                In August 2006, Ms. Eti Altman, the spokesperson for the "Let the Animals Live" organization, penned letters to 
                various government and state agencies. In these letters, she brought attention to the severe difficulties faced 
                by horses and donkeys in Israel. Ms. Altman urged the government to assume responsibility for the rescue 
                operations and the costly maintenance of these animals, which, until then, had been entirely funded by Zvika 
                Tamuz from his personal finances.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a consequence of these efforts, the Ministry for Environmental Protection initiated financial support for 
                the rescue operations of donkeys and horses. However, the challenge persisted regarding the provision of care 
                for these animals during their extended rehabilitation periods. There was a pressing need for an organization 
                to assume responsibility for these animals in Israel. Zvika tirelessly rescued dozens of horses and donkeys, 
                responding to distress calls at all hours, seven days a week. No report of a distressed horse or donkey was 
                overlooked. Concerns about owners attempting to reclaim or harm the animals hindered Zvika from publicly 
                disclosing rescue stories. He strongly urged the police not to disclose his name or address.

                In May 2007, a delegation from the International World Animal Protection (formerly WSPA) visited Israel. 
                Ms. Rivi Meier, the founder of The Society for Cats in Israel, accompanied the team to Zvika Tamuz's ranch. 
                This unexpected visit laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Pegasus Society.

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>   
                In our mission at the Pegasus Society, in collaboration with WAP, we embark on a transformative journey. 
                Our clear vision is to establish an educational center and visitor's facility aimed at raising awareness 
                about the challenges faced by horses and donkeys. We aspire to equip the public with tools to recognize 
                signs of distress in these animals.       
            </p>
            <p>
                At the 'Susita' sanctuary under the care of the Pegasus Society, horses and donkeys undergo comprehensive 
                physical and mental rehabilitation. Some find a permanent home at the sanctuary, where they receive ongoing 
                care for the entirety of their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of our future initiatives, the Pegasus Society is committed to launching an educational program. 
                This program will be inclusive, reaching both Jewish and Arab communities, with the aim of instilling 
                compassion and a sense of responsibility towards animals in the younger generation.
            </p>

        <div class="rehabilitation">
            <h3>Our Rehabilitation Process</h3>
            <p>
                We begin with a thorough assessment of the animal's health, including physical condition, injuries, 
                and behavioral issues
            </p>
            <p>
                We then address any medical issues promptly, including vaccinations, deworming, dental care, and treatment 
                for injuries or illnesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we gain better knowledge of the physical status of the animal, we design a balanced and nutritious diet 
                based on the individual needs of the horse or donkey.
            </p>
            <p>
                The equine is provided with a safe and comfortable shelter with proper ventilation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The horses and donkeys are gradually introduced to other animals in a controlled environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Physical excercie is important. We tailor the exercise routine to the individual needs and limitations of the 
                animal and provide mental stimulation through toys, interaction, and a stimulating environment all through 
                positive reinforcements.
