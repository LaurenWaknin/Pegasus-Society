            <div class="title">The Rescue of Pookey the Donkey</div>
            <img class="img-one" src="assets/before-after-one.png" alt="Donkey before/after image">
            <p>Pookey was discovered in an extremely dire condition on a farm, barely clinging to life. 
                When our team encountered him in 2010, his survival seemed highly unlikely.
                His situation represented the most severe neglect the welfare team had ever witnessed. 
                Pookey suffered from a skin infection in his face, and shockingly, his owners had opted 
                to worsen his condition by applying industrial-strength bleach to his wounds. 
                They callously tethered him to a pole, abandoning him to face an imminent demise.
                After his rescue, Pookey received crucial veterinary care that gradually healed his wounds. 
                However, it is the consistent care provided over months and years that has been instrumental 
                in fostering Pookey's confidence and rebuilding his trust in humans.

                Dimona, a city surrounded by desert, occasionally sees sick and injured donkeys venturing in 
                search of food and water. The donkey's innate curiosity often leads them into trouble, prompting 
                local Bedouins to tie their legs to prevent accidents on roads. A mare, desperately seeking 
                sustenance, walked into Dimona with her legs bound, likely causing injury. Three boys from Dimona, 
                Lior, Moshe, and Ilay, discovered her and noticed her distress. Concerned, they freed her, fed her, 
                provided water, and promptly reported the situation to Dr. Natalia Forost, the municipal vet. Dr. Natalia, 
                accompanied by Haim Verzky, verified the mare's condition and urgently contacted us. Upon arrival, we 
                found her miraculously surviving after days of wandering.

                Elvis was found in the rugged expanse of the West Bank, where day after grueling day, he bore the 
                burden of hauling unfathomably heavy cargo for a staggering 12 hours. When exhaustion overcame him, 
                the lash of cruelty compelled him to press on. One fateful day, a young girl, compelled by an 
                invisible force of empathy, stumbled upon this heart-wrenching spectacle. Unable to bear witness 
                to such injustice, she bravely confronted the owners. Their chilling response echoed with 
                indifference, challenging her to buy the donkey's freedom if she cared so much. 
                The girl sprinted home, emptied her savings and returned to the place of despair. She exchanged 
                currency for liberation, breaking the chains that bound Elvis to his torment. This young savior, 
                whose identity remainees anonymous, emerged as a beacon of hope for Elvis. She reached 
                out to us, transforming from a mere observer into Elvis's steadfast sponsor.
