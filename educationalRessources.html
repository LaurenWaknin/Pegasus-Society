                            including heat, cold, rain, and wind. Ensure the shelter is spacious enough for them to lie down comfortably.</li>
                        <li class="tips-li">Provide access to fresh, clean water at all times. Feed a balanced diet appropriate for donkeys, considering their age, 
                            weight, and activity level. Avoid overfeeding, as donkeys are prone to obesity.</li>

                            Rotate pastures to prevent overgrazing and ensure the availability of fresh grass.</li>
                        <li class="tips-li">Schedule regular hoof trims to prevent issues like overgrowth and lameness.
                            Ensure the hooves are cleaned and inspected for any signs of infection or injury.</li>
                        <li class="tips-li">Use positive reinforcement techniques for handling and training. Train donkeys for basic commands and behaviors

                        <li class="tips-li">Ensure the enclosure is secure to protect donkeys from predators. Install appropriate fencing and monitor for any potential hazards.</li>
